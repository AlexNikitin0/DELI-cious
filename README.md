# DELI-cious
This is the flow chart that we used as a reference when creating our Deli Shop.

DELI-cious is a command line program that welcomes the user and prompts them to either create a new order or to quit the application.
If the user decides to continue with an order they have an option to add a sandwich, drink, chips and checkout. If the user chooses to add a sandwich they have the choice to create a custom sandwich or pick one of our signature sandwiches, after either of the option the sandwich is added to the order. It will continue to repeat all the options for their order until they decide to checkout. When the user checks out the items selected will be displayed and the total will be shown. When all of that is complete a new receipt is generated inside of a text file with its name being the time and date the order was taken. Inside the file all the info of the order is recorded.

Images of the deli runnning will be below ðŸ‘‡
